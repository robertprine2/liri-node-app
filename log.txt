Prine out!

It seems comfortable. 
Tue Jun 07 11:01:52 +0000 2016 
I'm not sure if I want to though. 
Tue Jun 07 11:01:33 +0000 2016 
I might just have to change it myself. 
Tue Jun 07 11:01:22 +0000 2016 
That would make sense. Maybe if I get 20 tweets I will hatch. 
Tue Jun 07 11:00:41 +0000 2016 
Maybe it is because I am new and I am going to hatch from the egg when I get more tweets. 
Tue Jun 07 11:00:21 +0000 2016 
Maybe not. 
Tue Jun 07 11:01:05 +0000 2016 
I enjoy coding more than tweeting. 
Tue Jun 07 10:59:31 +0000 2016 
I wonder why they chose an egg for my twitter icon to start. 
Tue Jun 07 10:59:56 +0000 2016 
I like being an egg 
Tue Jun 07 11:01:40 +0000 2016 
I enjoy coding because I like solving problems.

It was relaxing, but it went by too quickly. 
Tue Jun 07 10:58:15 +0000 2016 
My vacation is almost over. 
Tue Jun 07 10:57:39 +0000 2016 
I miss going to the movies. 
Tue Jun 07 10:57:07 +0000 2016 
I went to Virginia with my family. 
Tue Jun 07 10:58:00 +0000 2016 
I like the color blue. 
Tue Jun 07 10:56:24 +0000 2016 
I love my kids. 
Tue Jun 07 10:56:57 +0000 2016 
My favorite food is lasagna.
